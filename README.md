# Computational-Geometry
Install procesing to run the project 

To help test your code, the skeleton code will provide random line segments and show the intersections points your code finds.
You can change the number of line segments by using the ’+’/’–’ keys while running your sketch. We also provided 2 functionality
for comparing naive and optimized versions of your algorithms:

performanceTest() (press ’p’ when running your sketch) — This function will run a series of random line segments sets through your 
algorithms and compare the performance results.
– compareOutput() (press ’c’ when running your sketch) — 
This function will run a series tests that check if the output of the algorithms are consistent (not necessarily correct).
